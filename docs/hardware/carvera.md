The [Makera Carvera CNC machine](https://www.makera.com){: target=_blank} with tool changes is a great addition to my home maker lab.  It allows me to work with many materials, to engrave, sculpt and cut.

In addition to the base machine I have the 4th axis module

and the PCB Fabrication pack

One of the key uses I make of this machine is to [create custom PCBs](../activities/pcb/index.md)
